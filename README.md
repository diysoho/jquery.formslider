# jquery.formslider [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/formslider/jquery.formslider.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/formslider/jquery.formslider) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/formslider/jquery.formslider/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/formslider/jquery.formslider)

This jquery.formslider integrates a modified [Flexslider](https://github.com/formslider/FlexSlider) with logical slide pages that can have features and behaviors provided by plugins.

The main goal is to have different actions triggered depending on what type the actual slide page is. You can stop going forward when a formula is invalid for example.

The Library is very small, performance optimized, full responsive and touch capable. You can easily write you own plugins and implement custom slide behavior.

## Installation
```bash
bower install jquery.formslider --save

# or

npm install jquery.formslider --save
```

## Integration
Follow the [Integration Guide](docs/INTEGRATION.md).

### Example use case
A possible use case is as follows:
  * you have a few **question slides** the user can answer and go forth and back
  * there is a **zipcode slide** the user enters a valid zip code
  * the **loader slide** makes a loading animation while navigation is blocked
  * the **contact slide** collects contact information and submits them together with the answers if the input is valid
  * the **confirmation slide** show information while no further navigation allowed

This functionality is provided by plugins. You can develop your own flow as you like by extend or configure plugins.
